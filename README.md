# -My-AWS-EC2-Launch-Lab-with-Public-and-Private-Subnets
In this project, I launched EC2 instances in both a public subnet and a private subnet using the AWS Console. I also explored the VPC wizard to quickly create VPC resources visually. By the end, my VPC had public and private resources ready to host applications! 🖥️☁️
